# Employee Dataset Analysis

The dataset contains data of 5000 employees including year of experience, salary, deductions, personal details, etc. I used some machine learnings to predict salary based on the data features, suach as: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and XGBoost.

The result is Linear Regression reached the highest R-squared value, 1.0, and also it has the lowest Mean Square Erro value, 8.58.
